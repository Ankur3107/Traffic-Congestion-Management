# Traffic Congestion Management
The objective of this project is to study the effectiveness of various machine learning models for the analysis and forecasting of a road traffic data timeseries. Subsequently, the most suitable model for the use-case has been determined and a prototype application called Traffic Congestion Management System is developed using R and Shiny Dashboard. The web application can predict the traffic conditions for a particular road intersection by training with the traffic data in a timeseries format.
